# Motivation
  I chose to study urban public transportation systems because I have used public transit for much of my life and I like that they make it possible to travel long distances without a car. Initially, I set out to compare the ridership by mode of travel of various major transportation systems in the U.S. I wanted to understand what traits of public transportation systems corralate with to high ridership.
# Data Gathering
  I accessed data on the theme that I was studying by using the open data portals maintained by public transit agencies (MBTA data portal: https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/, SEPTA data portal: https://wwww.septa.org/open-data/). I downloaded .csv files that documented ridership over time grouped by mode of travel from SEPTA, MBTA, CTA, and MTA to explore how I could combine data from the different agencies. Immediately, it became clear that this would be challenging. MTA and CTA separated each mode of travel into its own column while SEPTA and MBTA had a column dedicated to labeling each row by its mode of transportation. Additionally, the MBTA and SEPTA recorded daily averages within each month (written differentl,y) and CTA and MTA had daily totals. 
# Initial Data Processing
  I started by combining the SEPTA data and the MBTA data. In R Studio, I filtered out the weekday and weekend averages from the MBTA data set, so that I was left with only the rows with the daily average for all days in a given month. After that, I filtered out all rows refering to specific routes rather than the aggregated totals for a mode of travel. I then exported the spreadsheet from R Studio and opened it in Excel. In that program, I separated the "month_of_service" column into year and month columns using the left and right function to isolate the desired numbers from the string. With the prior steps completed, I had enough equivilent columns in the two data sets to combine them. I copy and pasted the year, month, "route_or_line" and "ridership_average" columns into each one's counterpart in the SEPTA data set, underneath the existing data. Following this process, I decided to limit my data set to these two agencies. Wrestling different standards of data collection to fit with what I had already done seemed like more of a challenge than I wanted. Additionally, I have the most personal experience with SEPTA and MBTA, so they carried more personal meaning for me than the other systems.
## Later Data Processing
  In order to create time series plots, I realized that I needed a way to put the dates of each set of rows in a form that R would recognize how to put in order. To do this, I made a new column in Excel, in which I wrote an expression to add the month divided by 12 to the year: [date value] = [year] + ([month]/12). This yielded decimal values after the digits of the year that increased in succession with each month (thanks, Professor DeFord for this idea!). 
# Visualizations
  I made a number of plots for exploratory data analysis. The following visualizations were the the ones that I found the most informative or interesting.
![Graph of MBTA and SEPTA average daily ridership by mode of travel](/1stVisualization.png)
This graph compares the daily average ridership of different types of public transit run by SEPTA in the Philadelphia metropolitan area and MBTA in the Boston metropolitan area. Each obesrvation corresponds to the average ridership in a month. Here we can tell that SEPTA's bus ridership surpasses that of the MBTA and far outstrips the heavy rail averages in its own system. MBTA's Heavy Rail tends to carry more riders than SEPTA's and a similar amount as the MBTA busses. MBTA heavy rail also has high variance, with noticable clusters of high and low outliers. In short, MBTA relies evenly on rail and busses, while SEPTA uses far more busses than rail. Commuter rail carries the least passengers in both systems.
