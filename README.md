# Motivation
I chose to study urban public transportation systems because I have used public transit for much of my life and I like that they make it possible to travel long distances without a car. Initially, I set out to compare the ridership by mode of travel of various major transportation systems in the U.S. I wanted to understand what traits of public transportation systems corralate with to high ridership.
# Data Gathering and Processing
I accessed data on the theme that I was studying by using the open data portals maintained by public transit agencies (MBTA data portal: https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/, SEPTA data portal: https://wwww.septa.org/open-data/). I downloaded .csv files that documented ridership over time grouped by mode of travel from SEPTA, MBTA, CTA, and MTA to explore how I could combine data from the different agencies. Immediately, it became clear that this would be challenging. 
# 1st Visualization
![Graph of MBTA and SEPTA average daily ridership by mode of travel](/1stVisualization.png)
This graph compares the daily average ridership of different types of public transit run by SEPTA in the Philadelphia metropolitan area and MBTA in the Boston metropolitan area. Each obesrvation corresponds to the average ridership in a month.
